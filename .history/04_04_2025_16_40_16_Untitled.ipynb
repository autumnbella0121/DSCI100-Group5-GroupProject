    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A research group in Computer Science at UBC has collected data from a Minecraft server, with the goal of predicting usage of a video game research server. This study investigates the factors associated with a player's decision to subscribe to a game-related newsletter. Such a subscription may serve as a proxy for deeper engagement with the server or interest in the research project.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Reseach Question**\n",
    "This study explores the question: *What player characteristics and behaviors are most predictive of subscribing to a game-related newsletter?*  \n",
    "More specifically, we ask: *Can age, gender, experience level, and hours played predict whether a player subscribes to the newsletter?*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset Description**\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this question, we analyze a dataset collected from the Minecraft research server. Each row in the dataset represents an individual player, with the following variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `experience`: The level or rank of the player (categorical)\n",
    "- `played_hours`: The number of hours the player has spent on the server (numerical)\n",
    "- `gender`: The gender identity of the player (categorical)\n",
    "- `age`: The age of the player in years (numerical, ordered)\n",
    "- `subscribe`: Whether the player subscribed to the game-related newsletter \n",
    "The response variable is `subscribe`, and the explanatory variables are `age`, `gender`, `experience`, and `played_hours`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This report will explore relationships between these variables and apply predictive modeling techniques to determine which characteristics are most useful in predicting newsletter subscription.\n"
